Bukkit Downloader

This is just a simple java GUI to download Bukkit/Craftbukkit (for minecraft) and any additional plugins.

Plugins are loaded from the plugins.prop file in the /config/ directory, it is auto created and updated from a centreal source when first run.
You are free to add more plugins to make your own custom file, it should not be overwritten. I have added only one setting so far and that is to 
redownload the plugins list from a different source, the source just has to be a a plain text file with no html or anything, recommended places 
to store the file is dropbox or any other upload site that offers direct downloads and in browser view of text files. The best way to store 
would be on your own web server.

Currently plugins are the only modular part of the system but I am planning to make it all modular.

If you wish to update the plugins.prop directory use this simple format:

Name=Url

At the moment only direct download to JAR files work, but zip support with auto extracting is planned.

The program downloads the files in the same directory as it is in, so put the jar file where you want to put the main stuff.
